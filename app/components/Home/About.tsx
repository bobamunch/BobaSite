      <h2>What is BOBA Munch?</h2>
      <p>
        BOBA Munch is a group based in the San Francisco Bay Area aiming to
        empower and support individuals to connect in the kink, sex positive,
        and queer spaces. We welcome individuals who identify with a broad range
        of identities including Asian, Asian American, Southeast Asian,
        Indian/South Asian, Middle Eastern, and Pacific Islander.
      </p>
      <p>
        We host and facilitate events throughout the Bay Area, including our
        in-person monthly munches. Unless otherwise stated, our official munches
        will be on the second Sunday of the month, rotating between San
        Francisco, East Bay, and San Jose.
      </p>
      <p>
        With recognition of the complex intersections of cultures, histories,
        and geographies that comprise our community, our intention is to create
        a welcoming space for a broad range of identities. If you identify as
        any of the aforementioned cultural groups, you are welcome to join us in
        our community where you can meet others with similar experiences. If
        not, please give us this space.
